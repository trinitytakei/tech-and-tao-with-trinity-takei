## Houston, we Have a Problem

Okay, time to admit it - my life is a hot mess!  

Not that I would have ever tried to conceal this fact _if I knew it_! (Well, a tiny voice tried to hint at it a few times, but I was too busy living the digital nomad dream to notice).

How is it possible I led a fubar'd life for years and being oblivious to the fact (to top it off, calling it 'living the dream')? Glad you asked! Here's how, in a nutshell:

I started to work remotely in 2007 - purely by accident (a story for another day). I went through a few things during this period - from the top of my head:

* I almost finished a PhD in computer science
* a bit before the finish line, I quit and co-founded a startup in India instead (with my then one and half years old daughter in tow)
* authored a relatively successful Ruby/Ruby on Rails tech blog for years
* was a technical editor of a few Ruby books
* played poker semi-professionally on-line until the US government shut it down
* at one point I had a fantastic home, brand new car, great (remote) job, the best wife on earth, kids, the whole nine yards - I have pretty much achieved what an average Joe could ever wish for, just way earlier
* a bit later, I sold or gave away everything I had except my laptop, a few clothes and personal belongings (still have the wife and the kids :-)) and started traveling full time
* we have lived mostly in Asia for the best part of 4 years. We have visited all continents, and about 70 countries (lost count years ago), staying for months, weeks, or sometimes just days at a time
* I made high six figures during this period (gawd I hate bragging (who starts a bragfest with a sentence like 'my life is a hot mess' anyway?) but I feel this detail is important to understand the whole picture)
* we eventually moved back to Europe and we are currently living in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain 

## What's the Catch?

Ummm wait, Trinity - we came here for the hot mess! The cataclysm! The shattered pieces, the broken dreams, the flop you implied in the opening line. Instead we only  Show. Me. The. Mess! 

Well, that's kind of the point. No Big Bad Thingâ„¢ happened (yet). I am living the digital nomad dream. Working location independently. Traveling whenever and wherewer I want to. Making a decent buck. Having great company 24/7 (my family). What else could I wish for?

So what the hell is the problem, then?!

Well, I feel empty on the inside: I don't enjoy my current work, no matter how well it pays. While traveling will always be a big part of my life, the honeymoon phase is over. It's like everlasting love stories: they start with the intensity of a thousand white-hot suns, but convert to a deep friendship over time. 

A slow burnout, spanning years, can be WAY worse than a sudden crash. Especially when you realize you should have changed course YEARS ago - and you didn't move a finger.

Inertia is a bitch: it's so easy to stay in your comfort zone. Just one more day in your cozy shell. To keep doing the same thing just because you know it works, and it's easy - why trade it for the uncertain? Perhaps at some point in the future, but surely not today. 

Then you wake up one day and you realize that something, no, EVERYTHING is off! And it just doesn't make sense. The emptiness is crushing. The fact that everything should be good, but it ISN'T, just fuels the frustration.

## I Think your Only Problem is that you are Crazy

I'm sure a lot of you shake your head in disbelief, thinking that 

* I'm working for the same client for the 9th year. It was fun in the very beginning (I joined a tiny startup) but got more boring and less challenging by the day once they got acquired
* 



But this is not a whining blog (although it will feature plenty of fuckups from time to time - they are part of the journey as much as the success).
