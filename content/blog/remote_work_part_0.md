I’m working on a series on remote work and living a nomadic lifestyle. The first two parts are almost ready: “Overview” (what are your possibilities if you want to work remotely, detailing the upsides/downsides of each), and  “Hacking the Job Interview by Never Taking One” (I’m working remotely since 2006, and never had a single job interview in my life! Find out how I pulled it off). Sign up to the mailing list at the bottom of the article if you'd like to be notified once I release them.


But first, let's start with a prologue: what challenges remote workers are facing? This is the single most asked question I’m getting on twitter, so I decided to finally answer it.

My aim is not to discourage you, but rather to paint a realistic picture of challenges you might face if you decide to go remote. Not all might apply to your situation, but it’s good to know about them anyway.

Here are a few things I wish someone told me before I got started with remote work:

1. Do NOT believe the hype (coding in the infinity pool on a tropical island, gentle breeze, bottomless mojitos, traveling all the time etc). I've been doing this for well over a decade, and it can be difficult every now and then. Loneliness, impostor syndrome, stress, lack of motivation, 'wtf I am doing’ days, chasing clients, feast or famine, burnout to name a few things. It’s better to be skeptical and being pleasantly surprised than the other way around.
2.  Get ready for loneliness - according to the [State of Remote Work 2018 Report by Buffer](https://open.buffer.com/state-remote-work-2018/), loneliness is the number one challenge remote workers are facing. To combat this, you need to proactively spend  a ton of time on networking: going to meetups, looking for activities, hitting up people online, meeting them for coffee (virtual or IRL) etc. Staying on the top of it all might be frustrating in the long term.
3. Communication - even though there are a myriad of tools facilitating collaboration on-line, they still leave something to be desired. Even if that weren’t an issue, some companies require set times for standups, meetings or even real-time communication via Slack or similar. To me, this kind of defeats the purpose of working remotely: what’s the point if you are tied to your desk anyway?
4. Motivation - the onus is on you to stay motivated and productive during work hours. While you are free from your pointy-haired boss peeking over your shoulder in the office (and that’s great!), you have to find ways to motivate yourself even if you don’t feel like to.
5. Time Zone Differences - most companies require you to be present when everyone else on your team is around. So if your company is in say, Boston, they will assume you are around 9-5 EST (give or take a few hours). This poses a problem if you’d like to stay in Asia, for example (in which case you would need to start working in the evening and finish at dawn). Talking to other remote workers I found that most companies don’t allow this in the first place (they want you to be in the same timezone, or maybe a hour or two behind/ahead, but not much more). So, even though you are not tied to a location, that location might have to be in a narrow vertical strip around your brick-and-mortar office.
6. Traveling  - You might think that hopping between all those exotic destinations is commonplace, but according to the State of Remote Work survey, 78% of remote workers are working from their home (I talked to a few Automattic employees during a retreat, and indeed - almost all of them are working from home). This makes sense - you have your own setup, reliable Wi-Fi, kitchen, you can take a nap whenever you want, be with your family etc. Even if you are a digital nomad, you won’t travel nearly as much as you think you will - constant setup, finding reliable wifi, the hassle of figuring out all the things in your new location all the time can be frustrating if you want to put in a good amount of work.
7.  Don’t expect coworking spaces to replace the camaraderie of the office - coworking spaces are rising in popularity, and they indeed look like a place of deep work and great socialization. As always, the reality is different from the Instagram images though: people come and go, just when you get to know someone, they’ll move on (or you will), you’ll still have to put a ton of work into building and maintaining relationships. Most of the time everyone will sit around with their headphones on.
8. Be *very* selective which jobs you accept. It's difficult in the beginning (especially if you are cash-strapped), as you just want to accept anything & everything and get down to it - resist the urge, your future self will thank you profoundly. It’s infinitely better to put more time into the preparation, collect a few offers and choose the best than just going with whatever yo get.
9.  Probably trivial, yet I see so many people crash and burn for this reason: money. Have enough money stoved away that makes you comfortable if you run out of jobs - for some people this could be few months of living expenses, for others it might be 2 years. Worrying about money can really kill your productivity & mood.
10. 40 hours in the office !== 40 hours working for yourself. The first scenario has tons of fuck-around time included (coffee, breakfast, water cooler chat, lunch, idiotic meetings, plain old procrastination), paperwork is taken care of, sick time and paid vacations are a thing - and as long as you show up, you get the same amount of salary. This is very different if you are a freelancer - you can’t bill for having lunch.
11. Don't underestimate the amount of time spent on creating systems to be productive, taking care of your food, health, workout, setting up and maintaining your hardware/software, job hunting, networking, paperwork and other admin tasks, chasing clients for payments and other yak shaving. Most of these things are trivial in the office, so much so that you consider them granted/normal.
12. In a 9-5 it's perfectly normal to ignore blogging, (serious, not full-of-cat-photos) social media presence, sharpening your saw, standing out from the crowd, working on open source etc. you'll have to do at least some (preferably more) of these if you are going at it alone. No one is going to do it for you.
13. You’ll need a wide range  of skills - if you are hired as a Javascript engineer in a ‘standard’ company, that’s what you are going to do daily (doh). However, if you are a freelancer, you need to be well-versed in so much more - communication, (copy)writing, networking, marketing, sales to name a few.
