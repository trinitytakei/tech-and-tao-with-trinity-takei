      <description>All of us have been there at some point: we decided to set up our first on-line store.
Picked and adjusted the theme carefully.
Chose the perfect items to sell.
Crafted ads to lead buyers to our site.
Asked friends and other store owners for feedback.
When it was all said and done, cut the ribbon and &amp;hellip; crickets.
Or rather, lots of lurkers, but no buyers.
At first, we calmed ourselves.</description>
