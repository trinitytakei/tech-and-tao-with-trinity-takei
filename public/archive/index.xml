      <description>Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, October 13th, Friday, 2017
Houston, we Have a Problem Okay, time to admit it - my life is a hot mess!
Not that I would have ever tried to conceal this fact if I knew it! (Well, a tiny voice tried to hint at it a few times, but I was too busy living the digital nomad dream to notice).
How is it possible I led a fubar&amp;rsquo;d life for years and being oblivious to the fact (to top it off, calling it &amp;lsquo;living the dream&amp;rsquo;)?</description>

      <description>All of us have been there at some point: we decided to set up our first on-line store.
Picked and adjusted the theme carefully.
Chose the perfect items to sell.
Crafted ads to lead buyers to our site.
Asked friends and other store owners for feedback.
When it was all said and done, cut the ribbon and &amp;hellip; crickets.
Or rather, lots of lurkers, but no buyers.
At first, we calmed ourselves.</description>
