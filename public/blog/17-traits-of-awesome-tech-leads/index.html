<p>Old programmers never die. They simply give up their resources.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the time of writing, I&rsquo;m not ready to give up my resources yet ( I&rsquo;m a long-running process!), but I have arrived at an earlier point happening to old programmers: they are cast (or coerced) into team leads, architects, or managers.</p>

<p>Most of my coder friends perceive a &lsquo;promotion&rsquo; like this as an epic fail of galactic proportions that any self-respecting programmer should try to avoid at all cost. At best, it&rsquo;s the worst thing that could happen to a coder; at worst, it&rsquo;s a pact with the devil (a.k.a the &lsquo;others&rsquo;, the non-coders, the suits, the pointy-haired bosses, the C-suite dwellers, the-guys-that-don&rsquo;t-do-shit-but-make-more-money-than-us), inevitably leading to your dismissal from the programmer&rsquo;s Valhalla on Earth and thereafter.</p>

<p>Dear friends, I have a confession to make: I&rsquo;m having the time of my life as a team leader! I have been happy as a clam cranking out code, and I was neither planning nor wishing for this, but now that it happened, I&rsquo;m even happier! [wipes laptop screen from rotten tomatoes].</p>

<p>Below is a summary of my leadership philosophy. I&rsquo;m new to this role, so you&rsquo;ll likely find some youthful naïveté entwined with threads of useful advice. Unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t have your cake and eat it too: similar articles are either lacking due to the curse of knowledge affecting veterans or oozing with a gung-ho slant of newly found joy by a rookie.</p>

<p>In other words, take it with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Okay, enough rambling - here&rsquo;s the list you actually came for, in no particular order:</p>

<p><strong>Teach Your Team to Fish</strong>: If I&rsquo;m coding (fishing myself), I&rsquo;m sure creating some value, but the real magic happens when I&rsquo;m teaching my team to fish: by reviewing their code, mentoring them, doing workshops for them, listening and actively trying to solve their problems (even real-life ones, if they share them with me - their well-being is of paramount importance on every level, if I expect them to churn out ninja code most of the time), praising them during sprint retros for their contributions and continually looking for feedback to improve my process of doing all of the above, setting an example along the way.</p>

<p><strong>Code Reviews - the Best Opportunity for Teaching</strong>: Probably my biggest superpower as a team leader is mentoring developers. There&rsquo;s more than one way to skin this cat (and then some), but I&rsquo;m finding a good code review session the most effective of all. It&rsquo;s organic: rather than explaining an abstract concept or unrelated code snippet I find interesting, we are discussing code he or she wrote (and thus, knows intimately and understands thoroughly), so the developer has (cat)skin in the game.</p>

<p>A word of warning- this goes both ways: bungle a code review (ignoring the pleas for the review because you have &lsquo;more important stuff to work on&rsquo; (what?!), doing a half-baked job or even scolding the committer for errors (worst idea ever)) and you&rsquo;ll deal more damage than you could with any other form of teaching. </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t take code reviews lightly, devote time to them as soon as possible and treat the author with utmost respect if you want your mentoring to sink in. Try asking &lsquo;how could we make this better?&rsquo; instead of saying &lsquo;this is wrong!&rsquo;</p>

<p><strong>Know thy Protégés and Help Them to Level Up Accordingly</strong>: Do not force round pegs into square holes. Case in point: no amount of pleading, rationalizing, bait-dangling or any other tactic will ever turn hardcore coders into happy team leads.</p>

<p>Sure, because of your authority, you can turn them into resentful managers, always yearning to go back to their beloved code - but unless your goal is to demonstrate the Peter principle in action, bad managers are… bad. </p>

<p>Turn great programmers into 10x developers, and look elsewhere for future managers.</p>

<p>Some team members will have a knack for writing, refactoring, testing, or showing a potential of becoming good team leaders themselves - train them accordingly. Know your team members personally, and play to their strength.</p>

<p><strong>Look for Your Successor From Day One</strong>: In my previous point, I mentioned that some team members might show promising potential of becoming team leaders themselves.</p>

<p>Identifying and training them is THE most important task you have as a team leader: it&rsquo;s much more difficult to find and train future leaders than anyone else on your team. Also, future leaders will have a more profound impact on the organization than anyone else on your team.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching Soft Skills is Crucial</strong>: Even when a team member&rsquo;s sole task is writing code day in, day out (i.e., a typical junior to mid-level dev role), a good chunk of &lsquo;writing code&rsquo; is spent on everything but writing code.</p>

<p>Most of the time is spent on honing the ancient art of yak shaving: communication, understanding of tasks, fumbling with git, configuring your system, updating unrelated software, mending rejected pull requests, hardware failures, documentation, wifi issues, asking questions, answering questions-the list is endless.</p>

<p>And then there are the non-strictly-coding tasks: meetings (that I find difficult to survive more often than not, and I&rsquo;m assuming this is true for most devs), writing emails, explaining stuff, asking for raises, leveling up, office politics-another endless list.</p>

<p>Let me share a real-life example: I noticed that one of my more senior devs was routinely deflecting praise like a pro - all the time, without fail. I sent him this email [unredacted, except the real name]:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey Joe,</p>

<p>I came across this article today and it made me think about you instantly:</p>

<p><a href="https://anaulin.org/blog/self-deprecation-bad-habit/">https://anaulin.org/blog/self-deprecation-bad-habit/</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been with the team for less than 2 months, but I can already see that you are doing it all the time:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yo Joe, great work&rsquo; -&gt; you: ah, it&rsquo;s nothing
&lsquo;Hey Joe really thanks for all the bugfixes&rsquo; -&gt; you: no, it was not a big thing, and the whole team worked on it, and it was easy and quick and …</p>

<p>I have to call BS! You are doing fantastic work [and it&rsquo;s not easy, quick, etc.], right now you are the fucking Messi of the team - you practically banged out 80% of the work for the last two sprints. This is a fact [please do not reply with &lsquo;No, that&rsquo;s not true, because … &lsquo; :-D]</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in the same shoes btw. - I&rsquo;m fighting impostor syndrome all the time, I feel really awkward when people give me praise, and I wish they would just shut up and leave me alone :-) I have been way worse, but I&rsquo;m forcing myself to get better, and just say &lsquo;Thank you&rsquo; if nothing else, and move on. It feels weird, but gets better over time if you start practicing it.</p>

<p>I liked this section:</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I&rsquo;ve grown into leadership roles, I&rsquo;ve also come to see the negative effects of my self-deprecating speech on my teams. If your manager or lead keeps trying to make herself small, what does that mean for you? If she really doesn&rsquo;t believe that she is that good, you&rsquo;re really a long way off from mastery yourself, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>You are eventually going to grow into a leadership role (and by seniority, you are already in a leadership role right now) and your team needs to hear that you are doing great work - so don&rsquo;t make yourself small (there are enough envious and malicious people who are ready to do that for you <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Joe expressed his gratitude in a reply email and indeed, I didn&rsquo;t notice him deflecting praise ever since, at least not in my presence.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like I taught him a new language or methodology, but these small steps can add up in the long haul.</p>
