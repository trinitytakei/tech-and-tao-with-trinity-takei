      <description>Old programmers never die.
They simply give up their resources.
 At the time of writing, I&amp;rsquo;m not ready to give up my resources yet ( I&amp;rsquo;m a long-running process!), but I have arrived at an earlier point happening to old programmers: they are cast (or coerced) into team leads, architects, or managers.
  Image Credit: https://dilbert.com/strip/2017-03-24   Most of my coder friends perceive a &amp;lsquo;promotion&amp;rsquo; like this as an epic fail of galactic proportions that any self-respecting programmer should try to avoid at all cost.</description>

      <description>Photo by Allen Leigh on Unsplash   Perhaps the most frequent question in every digital nomad group is some variation of &amp;lsquo;where should I travel next and what should I do there.&amp;rsquo;
I&amp;rsquo;m proposing a simple guide to help you with your decision: the Instagram Test.
It&amp;rsquo;s straightforward: are you going to a place primarily to take a selfie? So that you can hang it on your Instagram/Facebook wall later?</description>

      <description>One of the first questions I’m asked online (by people who don’t know me personally) is: “…but your real name isn’t Trinity, right”?
  The real Trinity (ie not me)   It’s annoying: there are infinite names that are not my real name (for example John Smith, Михаил Горбачёв, Thomas A. Anderson, まつもとゆきひろ, or Drago Lončar), yet I can hardly imagine anyone asking me “but your real name isn’t John [Михаил, Thomas, ゆきひろ, Drago], right?</description>

      <title>What Won&#39;t Most Digital Nomads Tell You?</title>

      <description>It’s virtually impossible (or at least damn hard) to get an objective answer to this question. There are various cognitive biases in play, which are as varied as digital nomads themselves.
  Photo by rawpixel on Unsplash   In the past decade, I have traveled extensively as a digital nomad/expat and met
 9-5 people who never wanted to be digital nomads 9-5 people craving to be digital nomads, only to regret the decision in a matter of months 9-5 people on a year-long sabbatical (backpackers, burned out 9-5ers, wannabe entrepreneurs) who claimed they are digital nomads, but went back to 9-5 after they ran out of money 9-5 people turned digital nomads who are happy ever since (yours truly, for example - although I wouldn’t call myself a true digital nomad, but that’s an entirely different can of worms, best to be left untouched for now) digital nomads who never held a 9-5 job, and love it/hate it/want to escape it/didn’t figure it out yet/never will former digital nomads who were happy to go back to 9-5 and are on cloud nine ever since (even though they were escaping the 9-5 grind before going remote) people switching between 9-5 and remote/digital nomad lifestyle, always craving the one they are not currently in (obviously, the problem is elsewhere in their case) all sorts of successful people working remotely (who might-but usually don’t-call themselves a digital nomad) looking down on digital nomads (in their definition, a crowd of clueless ~20-year-old backpackers, trying to look cool with their MacBooks) single guys/gals, couples, friends, families, small or large groups traveling together (spontaneously or via one of the companies organizing it) who I would consider DNs &amp;hellip; and a lot of people not quite fitting into either, or combining more of the above boxes plus, there is undoubtedly an endless list of further categories I don’t even have an idea about    Photo by Dan Gribbin on Unsplash   And, if this weren’t enough, people are in constant state of flux; for example, I have seen DNs progress like this (there might be more, or less, and definitely different states as well):</description>
